# EnergyAgent_SW
Embedded SW that can measure Power consumption and trigger a Relay when needed.

This is work in progress.....

Aim:
A remote "user" can:
	request the actual powerconsumption
	Ask the device to open the relay
	Ask the device to open the relay if consumtion gets below a specified level
	.... (Perhaps more will come)

All the the rules besides this, should be done from other devices.
